# KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS

## About Kickstarter Campaigns
The kickstarter campaigns are used when creators/visionaries share their vision with a wider community and want this community to fund their vision. 

Every project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. If people like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when time expires.
